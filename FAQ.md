# Questions you might have...

- **Would I consider making forms for jobs like Trucking, Cargo Pilot or Train Conductor?**

  Personally, no. The original intent for this project is to provide meaningful feedback to the developers. Whether that be route distances that affect rewards or how a particular job may flow between each stop.

  The jobs mentioned have a linear flow to their progression, not so much on how you might do it but rather what is needed to increase your level or effectiveness.

- **What other jobs might be added in the future?**  

  - Mechanic
  - Street Racer (static data only, with a possibility for timings to be recorded as well...)

- **Is there a possibility to add some job logging feature to the server?** 

  > (Question on my own part)  

  It is *likely* if intergrated correctly and doesn't hinder the gameplay or experience of the server. But that would be up to the management team, and developers if they can implement it without having to change a lot of what already exists.

- **How can I contribute?**

  - Submitting data required for a job
  - Submitting useful job info that other players can use  
    (i.e. distances between locations, time taken to travel between locations)

- **Why?**

  Because. Just because.

  But seriously, it's better than doing nothing at all.
