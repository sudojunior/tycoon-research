# Driver Credit

The idea is that a player would be able to submit their player ID when they complete a run and report what they got and anything that should be noted about the route when using a particular vehicle (or other conditions like weather, time of day, etc.). ~~Unsure what the incentive should be for that...~~

Additional perspective is that you contribute to the ecosystem of the game as it continues to change, ~~not sure if glitch or collins will end up seeing this but we'll see.~~

This initially was to give credit for player based research, but serves to be a form of identification should bulk submission occur or edits be required.
