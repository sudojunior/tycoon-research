## Distance Calculations

Distance calculations are as close as possible when using GTA's navigation, in the event that it fails manual calculation will be noted down from stop to stop.

Stop to Stop calculations were made using gta-5-map.com as a tool to pin and identify routes. Then going around while free-roaming (preferably in a faster vehicle) placing a waypoint on the map, noting down the distance the game has calculated, driving to it, and repeat until I reach the end of the route. (All data from the map tool would then be deleted, to make room for new tests/research)

~~gtagmodding.com/maps/gta5/ may also be used to provide exact coordinates for locations on the map, however may not work for map modifications like Liberty City.~~ Look at using debug mode instead, accurate coordinates available from the client.

> Point to Point navigation will be used if GTA navigation does not work (for Airplanes, Helicopters and Boats).
