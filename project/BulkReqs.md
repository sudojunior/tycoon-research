# Bulk submission requirements

For a bulk submission to happen, I will need:

- A player ID (which also requires you to submit a response to driver credit - explained very poorly below)
- A spreadsheet with the respective values asked for in each document (you may give whatever headers you like so long as I can either understand what the headers are, or you provide an explanation for what they are exactly).

The reason for this is because of the large dataset that is being transferred at once, rather than individual journey data. If you want (for Google Sheets, Excel, etc.) you can also include graphs for specific routes / deployments / etc. (I like a lot of graphs ðŸ™‚)
